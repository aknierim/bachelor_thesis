\chapter{Conclusions and Outlook}
\label{ch:conclusions}

In the scope of this work, the hyperparameters for each of the four currently (as of writing this thesis)
implemented cleaning algorithms were searched via a grid search. The resulting hyperparameters were then
probed \wrt a combined metric of the angular resolution and the efficiency. These results led to a subset
consisting of the best-performing hyperparameters for each cleaning algorithm. Furthermore, a comparison between the
optimized algorithms and the default algorithms, as well as a comparison between each respective
cleaner was performed.

Most of the data (pre-)processing in this work was done with \gls{cta}'s open-source low-level data processing pipeline
software \ctapipe{}, version \texttt{0.15.1}. The data used was PROD5 \gls{mc} data consisting of
\(\num{1.3}\)\,M telescope events (\sim\(\num{620}\)\,k array events) throughout \(987\) runs. The data
was processed from raw \texttt{simtel} data (\rzero) up to cleaned (\dloa) and parametrized (\dlob) levels
for the metrics as well as reconstructed (\dlt) data for the efficiency and angular resolution.
Further high-level processing was done with this works pipeline as described in \autoref{sec:pipeline}.

The four implemented cleaning algorithms can be roughly categorized into time-based (\fact{} and \tcc) and non-time-based
algorithms (\tailcuts{} and \mars{}). While the non-time-based algorithms only take thresholds of the photon count of each pixel
into account, the time-based algorithms also set limits on the arrival time of each pixel. This allows
for a lower core threshold \(Q_c\) for the photon count per pixel, which in turn can lead to better
results from the cleaning process. A good cleaning not only reduces data size---as a majority of the
pixels in the image are made up by \gls{nsb}---but it also allows for a better parameterization and in turn
a better reconstruction of the events.

The main results of this thesis are the hyperparameters for the cleaning algorithms.
Due to the long runtimes of the grid searches and the time limit of this thesis, however, the cleaning
algorithms so far. The optimal hyperparameters of each cleaning algorithm for
the \glspl{mst} are listed in \autoref{tab:best_parameters}. A further grid search with only \gls{lst}
data would be necessary to find the remaining core and boundary thresholds \(Q_c\) and \(Q_b\).
\todo{how did it perform against the default parameters?}

Additionally, a comparison between the optimized algorithms themselves was performed. This led to \fact{}
being the best performing algorithm overall \wrt the metrics, albeit only a slight advantage over the
other algorithms.
